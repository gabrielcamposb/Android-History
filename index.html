            <h1>Android Mascot History</h1>

            <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices around the world. But perhaps you don't know that your friendly mascot has a very curious name and story? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>

            <h2>The First Version</h2>

            <p>The first attempt to create a mascot appeared in 2007 and came from a developer called <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103 /" target="_blank" class="external">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/pt/" target="_blank" class="external">Inkscape</a> (free software for image vectorization) and created his own version of a robot. The objective was just to personify the system for its team only, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: they would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>

            <h2>A new mascot appears</h2>

            <p>The idea of ​​having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="_blank" class="external">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a unique way. more pleasant.</p>

            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick identification with those who look at it. Then came <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, Android's new mascot.</p>

            <img src="images/bugdroid.png" class="small" alt="Bugdroid">

            <p>A principal inspiração para os traços do novo <strong>Bugdroid</strong> veio daqueles bonequinhos que ilustram portas de banheiro para indicar o gênero de cada porta. Conta a lenda que a artista estava criando em sua mesa no escritório do <strong>Google</strong> e olhou para o lado dos banheiros e a identificação foi imediata: simples, limpo, objetivo.</p>

                <p>Another curious issue regarding Android is that each version has always been named after a sweet, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>
                
                <ul>
